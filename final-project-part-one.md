# Outline
> My project will explore how museums can successfully manage their exhibition departments while establishing digital collection platforms, particularly in response to rising digital engagement. Exhibitions are often the driving force of museums â€” shaping audience experience, educational outreach, and revenue generation. Yet, sustaining them requires robust funding and efficient management.

In addition, major museums are increasingly investing in digital collections to expand access, allowing the public to engage with artworks online for research, education, and pre-visit planning. This digital expansion, however, depends on increased awareness and financial support from donors and stakeholders.

Through this project, I aim to highlight the importance of exhibitions and digital collections as essential components of museum sustainability. I will use data on audience participation, museum contributions to the economy, exhibition costs within museum budgets, and survey responses to digital collections. By presenting these insights, I hope to show why increased investment in exhibition departments and digital infrastructure is necessary for the future of museums.
