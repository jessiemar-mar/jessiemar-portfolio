# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Ensure clarity and visual consistency in data visualizations | Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts. |
| Check whether the core narrative is clear | What message do you feel was emphasized most strongly throughout the story? |
| Identify gaps or missing perspectives | What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing for you? |
| Test the effectiveness of the opening hook | When you look at the chart (very first one) showing the arts’ contribution to state economies, what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value? |
| Evaluate the curator expertise argument | When you see a chart (last second) on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums? |
| Assess the persuasiveness of digital collections | How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites? |
