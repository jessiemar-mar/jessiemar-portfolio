# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My approach was to identify individuals who represent potential supporters of museums, including philanthropists, cultural leaders, and community stakeholders. I hope to reach audiences who may not fully recognize how art contributes to employment and the economy, particularly through museums and exhibitions. At the same time, I want to show how the rise of digital technology creates new opportunities for digital collections, expanding access and strengthening the relevance of exhibitions for future generations.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Ensure clarity and visual consistency in data visualizations | Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts. |
| Check whether the core narrative is clear | What message do you feel was emphasized most strongly throughout the story? |
| Identify gaps or missing perspectives | What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing for you? |
| Test the effectiveness of the opening hook | When you look at the chart (very first one) showing the arts’ contribution to state economies, what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value? |
| Evaluate the curator expertise argument | When you see a chart (last second) on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums? |
| Assess the persuasiveness of digital collections | How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites? |


## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1 — MAM (23, Visual Art) | Interview 2 — MAM (23, Theatre) | Interview 3 — MAM (26, Theatre) | Interview 4 — Fine Art Painter (33) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts.** | Only for the first one I was trying to read the title to know what the numbers represent. Had a hard time navigating the employment part on the right — maybe it’s small. | National Gallery of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, MoMA; Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based on Occupations. | No problem with most charts. For Visitor Preference pie charts, consider colors—colorblind users may have difficulty. | Add more color contrast in “2023 Top 10 Most Culturally Vibrant States’ Arts’ Economic Value and Employment” and “Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based On Occupations.” |
| **What message do you feel was emphasized most strongly throughout the story?** | Audience engagement is trending more digital than physical; people prefer digital. | Diversity of artists in major museums. | Decline of museums’ economic output and attendance, which seems counter to the “good investment” argument. | Factors that make arts & culture important to state economies; curators and art jobs pay well. |
| **What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing?** | Everything makes sense. I wonder if the first graph (top 10 state economic value & employment) is necessary—employment is fine but might be a sidetrack. | Broad perspectives but concise presentation; it brings the story together. | You describe a gap as an investment opportunity; specify the type of investment opportunity, then prove it with graphs. Starting with text instead of a graph may feel less intimidating. | Clear statements at the beginning and the end. |
| **When you look at the first chart (arts’ contribution to state economies), what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value?** | It suggests museums aren’t adding a lot of economic value, though they have many audiences (most museums are nonprofit). The numbers are lower than I imagined. | Yes—especially the difference between states on the left and right. | Interesting that California is ahead of New York given NY’s major museums; losing arts would be a significant economic loss to each state. | Clear that California plays a huge role in the arts economy; surprising it’s “bigger” than New York. |
| **When you see the chart on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums?** | Yes—data suggests curators are very much needed. | Sort of; it can make it look like other occupations have negative value. | A bit confusing—understandable but takes too much effort if the goal is an obvious visual. | Yes, though I’m still struck by how small the number of African artists is in big institutions; I might need more factors to see curators’ importance from this. |
| **How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites?** | Very convincing. Strongest are public participation, visitor preference, and museum attendance charts—already very persuasive. | Very much so, especially the graph on digital technology usage for how audiences engage with art. | Well thought out and provides a good case for digital collections and websites. | Advanced. |
