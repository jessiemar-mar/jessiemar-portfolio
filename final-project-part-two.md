# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My approach was to identify individuals who represent potential supporters of museums, including philanthropists, cultural leaders, and community stakeholders. I hope to reach audiences who may not fully recognize how art contributes to employment and the economy, particularly through museums and exhibitions. At the same time, I want to show how the rise of digital technology creates new opportunities for digital collections, expanding access and strengthening the relevance of exhibitions for future generations.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Ensure clarity and visual consistency in data visualizations | Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts. |
| Check whether the core narrative is clear | What message do you feel was emphasized most strongly throughout the story? |
| Identify gaps or missing perspectives | What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing for you? |
| Test the effectiveness of the opening hook | When you look at the chart (very first one) showing the arts’ contribution to state economies, what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value? |
| Evaluate the curator expertise argument | When you see a chart (last second) on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums? |
| Assess the persuasiveness of digital collections | How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites? |


## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1 — MAM (23, Visual Art) | Interview 2 — MAM (23, Theatre) | Interview 3 — MAM (26, Theatre) | Interview 4 — Fine Art Painter (33) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts.** | Only for the first one I was trying to read the title to know what the numbers represent. Had a hard time navigating the employment part on the right — maybe it’s small. | National Gallery of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, MoMA; Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based on Occupations. | No problem with most charts. For Visitor Preference pie charts, consider colors—colorblind users may have difficulty. | Add more color contrast in “2023 Top 10 Most Culturally Vibrant States’ Arts’ Economic Value and Employment” and “Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based On Occupations.” |
| **What message do you feel was emphasized most strongly throughout the story?** | Audience engagement is trending more digital than physical; people prefer digital. | Diversity of artists in major museums. | Decline of museums’ economic output and attendance, which seems counter to the “good investment” argument. | Factors that make arts & culture important to state economies; curators and art jobs pay well. |
| **What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing?** | Everything makes sense. I wonder if the first graph (top 10 state economic value & employment) is necessary—employment is fine but might be a sidetrack. | Broad perspectives but concise presentation; it brings the story together. | You describe a gap as an investment opportunity; specify the type of investment opportunity, then prove it with graphs. Starting with text instead of a graph may feel less intimidating. | Clear statements at the beginning and the end. |
| **When you look at the first chart (arts’ contribution to state economies), what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value?** | It suggests museums aren’t adding a lot of economic value, though they have many audiences (most museums are nonprofit). The numbers are lower than I imagined. | Yes—especially the difference between states on the left and right. | Interesting that California is ahead of New York given NY’s major museums; losing arts would be a significant economic loss to each state. | Clear that California plays a huge role in the arts economy; surprising it’s “bigger” than New York. |
| **When you see the chart on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums?** | Yes—data suggests curators are very much needed. | Sort of; it can make it look like other occupations have negative value. | A bit confusing—understandable but takes too much effort if the goal is an obvious visual. | Yes, though I’m still struck by how small the number of African artists is in big institutions; I might need more factors to see curators’ importance from this. |
| **How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites?** | Very convincing. Strongest are public participation, visitor preference, and museum attendance charts—already very persuasive. | Very much so, especially the graph on digital technology usage for how audiences engage with art. | Well thought out and provides a good case for digital collections and websites. | Advanced. |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Do you feel any distraction or confusion when looking at the charts (color, chart types, labels)? Please tell me which graphs and parts.** | It was good. Only for the first one I was just trying my best to see the title so that I know which are these numbers representing – and I had a little bit hard time navigating the employment part which was on the right – and maybe it's kinda small. | National Gallery of Art, Art Institution of Chicago, MoMA; Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based on Occupations. | Could add more color contrast in the chart "2023 Top 10 Most Culturally Vibrant States' Arts’ Economic Value and Employment" and "Arts Management Average Wage & Population Based On Occupations." | No problem with most charts. For Visitor Preference pie charts, consider colors — colorblind users may have difficulty. | — |

| **What other information or perspectives would help make this story more complete or convincing for you?** | All the information totally makes sense to me. The only thing I wonder is whether the first graph (top 10 state economic value and employment) is necessary — it’s okay to support the data about each state later in the story, but employment is fine as a side track. | The perspectives are broad in concept but concise in presentation, which really brings the story together. | Clear statements at the beginning and the end. | You describe a gap as an investment opportunity; specify the type of investment opportunity, then prove it with graphs. Starting with text instead of a graph may feel less intimidating. | — |
| **When you look at the first chart (arts’ contribution to state economies), what does it tell you? Does it change how you think about museums’ value?** | It’s telling me museums are not adding a lot of economic value, though they must have a lot of audiences (I’m MAM so I know most museums are nonprofit). But it does change what I think because the numbers are much lower than I would imagine. | Yes — especially seeing the difference between the states on the left and right side. | Clear that California plays a huge role in the arts economy; surprising it’s “bigger” than New York. | Interesting that California is ahead of New York given NY’s major museums; losing arts would be a significant economic loss to each state. | — |
| **When you see the chart on average wages and workforce size in arts management, does it highlight the value of curators’ expertise needed in museums?** | I think so — from the data curators are very much needed. | Sort of, though it makes it look like there is a negative value associated with the other occupations. | Yes, though I’m still struck by how small the number of African artists is in big institutions; I might need more factors to see curators’ importance from this. | A bit confusing — understandable but takes too much effort if the goal is to make an obvious visual. | — |
| **How convincing is the case for investing in digital collections and websites?** | It is very convincing. Among them I think the most relevant and convincing ones are “public participating” and “visitor preference.” The museum attendance one also — together these make a very convincing case. | Very much so! Especially the graph that depicted digital technology usage for how audiences engage with art. | Advanced. | Well thought out and provides a good case for digital collections and websites. | — |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

| Research synthesis (Findings or observations from interviews) | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|---|---|
| Some charts were confusing to read (small text, hard-to-navigate employment section). | Increase font size, simplify layout, and enlarge sections that were hard to follow. |
| Color choices in certain charts (e.g., Visitor Preference pie charts, Top 10 States chart) may cause difficulty for colorblind viewers or reduce clarity. | Adjust color palette for higher contrast and accessibility. |
| Audiences picked up on different messages: digital engagement, diversity of artists, economic decline, and cultural contribution to state economies. | Refine and clarify the core storyline so the central message is emphasized consistently. |
| The first chart (Top 10 states by economic value) felt unnecessary or distracting to some participants. | Consider removing, simplifying, or reframing this chart to better support the main argument. |
| Some interviewees asked for more detail on the type of “investment opportunity” being proposed. | Add explicit explanation of the investment area (e.g., digital collections, curatorial expertise) early in the story. |
| The chart on average wages and workforce size was seen as confusing; not all participants found curators’ importance clearly highlighted. | Add annotations or text to connect the chart more directly to the value of curators. |
| Strong agreement that the case for investing in digital collections and websites is convincing. | Emphasize digital participation trends more clearly and strengthen with additional supporting data. |
