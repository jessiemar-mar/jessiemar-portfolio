# The final data story
Link to my final data story on [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-future-of-museum-investment-exhibitions-and-digital-access/index.html) 


## The audience
The primary audience for this data story is a mid-career philanthropist and investor who manages wealth through a family foundation and seeks to balance legacy, cultural influence, and social responsibility. This audience represents a donor archetype that values data-driven insights and institutional alignment before committing to any long-term investment in the arts.

They are motivated by supporting inclusive, future-focused art initiatives, yet are unsure which areas of art to invest in. Their decision-making relies on trusted advisors, foundation reports, and firsthand experiences at high-profile art events, and they prefer concise, evidence-based communications that clearly demonstrate both impact potential and financial prudence.

## Final design decisions
Throughout the process, I constantly revisited how to rearrange my data visualizations to strengthen the overall storyline. The project evolved significantly from Part I, where my opening story initially focused on how the arts contribute to U.S. economic value and employment by state, then unfolded into the challenges and opportunities within the sector. Over time, I recognized the need for a more focused and emotionally engaging narrative. Instead of opening with broad economic data, I began with the current challenges museums face—declining federal support and IMLS funding cuts—to immediately establish urgency and relevance.

After setting that context, I compared museums to other art forms using data on public participation, GDP value added, and average growth, illustrating that museums currently have the lowest indicators yet hold strong potential if funding is strategically directed. I then introduced targeted solutions and investment pathways to guide donors toward meaningful action. Finally, I concluded with data showing how the arts contribute to U.S. economic value and employment as a positive, hopeful message—inspiring donors to envision the long-term growth and impact their investments could create.

At the end of the story, I provided insights to guide potential philanthropists, outlining key factors to consider when exploring investments in museums and exhibitions. I concluded with a call to action, encouraging them to explore different giving options—such as endowments, art acquisitions, and donor-advised fund gifts—and determine which best align with their financial planning and areas of focused support.

Informed by interview feedback, I also refined my visual language using a moodboard-inspired color system—pink to highlight opportunities and green to represent challenges—to create contrast and guide attention. I removed datasets that distracted from the main narrative, such as artist diversity and curatorial salary data, ensuring the storyline remained focused on digital collections and investment strategy. Feedback about clarifying “investment opportunities” also led me to emphasize a stronger call to action, connecting data insights with actionable options aligned with donor goals and museum sustainability.
